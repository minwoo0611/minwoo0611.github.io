# **About Me** 

I obtained B.S in Consturction and Environmental Enginnering(CEE) at KAIST, South Korea. Now, I am pursuing M.S advised by Prof. [Ayoung Kim](https://ayoungk.github.io/) in the [RPM lab](https://rpm.snu.ac.kr/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, SNU(Seoul National University).

My research topics are related with LiDAR sensor such as simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) and sensor fusions.
